“GA4 analytics baseline”, I meant setting up the minimum viable event tracking in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) for your MVP so you can measure usage from Day 1.

Here’s what a GA4 baseline for your JEE MVP slice should include:

⸻

🎯 Core Purpose
	•	See how many users land, log in, learn, and quiz.
	•	Track funnel drop-offs (e.g., many land → few log in → even fewer reach quiz).
	•	Build early insight for iteration.

🔑 GA4 Baseline Events

You don’t need every detail yet — just the critical path:
	1.	Landing
	•	page_view (auto by GA4)
	•	Custom event: trial_started (when they start 2-topic trial)
	2.	Login
	•	login_attempt (phone + captcha submitted)
	•	login_success (user actually enters system)
	3.	Learning Flow
	•	topic_opened (subject → topic view)
	•	topic_completed (finish one trial topic)
	4.	Quiz
	•	quiz_started (first question shown)
	•	quiz_completed (quiz submitted)
	•	quiz_score (parameter with % score or marks)
	5.	Chatbot
	•	chat_opened (user opens chat window)
	•	chat_message_sent (student sends question)
	•	chat_response_received (bot responds — useful for latency monitoring)
	6.	Analytics Metadata (as event parameters)
	•	user_id (if logged in)
	•	subject / topic
	•	time_spent (optional, but can come later)

⸻

📊 Dashboards (Simple)

For MVP, just build 3 dashboards in GA4 / Looker Studio:
	1.	Funnel View – landing → login → topic start → topic complete → quiz complete
	2.	Engagement View – avg. time spent per topic, chat usage frequency
	3.	Performance View – quiz scores distribution

⸻

🛠️ Implementation Tip
	•	Use Google Tag Manager (GTM) → fire events on clicks, completions, or state changes.
	•	Add GA4 SDK to your web React app (client side).
	•	Keep naming consistent (snake_case or camelCase) from start so you don’t have to redo later.

✅ So, GA4 analytics baseline = minimum set of events + funnel dashboards to track MVP’s success.

👉 Do you want me to draft a sample GA4 event schema (JSON-style) for your product so your devs/interns can just plug it into the React app?
